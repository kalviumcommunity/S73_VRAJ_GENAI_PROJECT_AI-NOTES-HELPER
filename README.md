# üìò AI Notes Helper (Gemini Version)

This is a **basic AI project** built with the **Google Gemini API**.  
The goal is simple ‚Üí show how different **prompting + AI concepts** work using notes.  
Each feature is kept **very basic** and is implemented in a **separate branch**.

---

## üîé About the Project

- **Frontend:** plain HTML, CSS, JS (basic UI)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini API  
- Each branch has **one feature** ‚Üí easy to test and learn  
- This project is for **learning + demo only**, not production  

---

## ‚ö° Features (7 Concepts)

Each point is done in its own **branch**.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ System + User Prompt
- Example of using both **system** (instructions for model behavior) + **user input**.  
- Example:  
  - System: "You are a notes helper. Always explain simply."  
  - User: "Explain photosynthesis."  
  ‚Üí Output: "Plants make food using sunlight, water, and air."

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Zero-Shot Prompting
- Directly ask Gemini without any examples.  
- Example:  
  > "Summarize this note in 2 lines: <note_text>"

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ One-Shot Prompting  
- Give **one example** to guide the model.  
- Example:  
  > Example: "Photosynthesis ‚Üí Plants make their own food."  
  Now do the same for this note: <note_text>

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Shot Prompting 
- Give **multiple examples** for better learning.  
- Example:  
  > Example 1: "Newton‚Äôs Law ‚Üí Objects keep moving unless stopped."  
  > Example 2: "Photosynthesis ‚Üí Plants make food using sunlight."  
  Now explain: <note_text>

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Prompting
- Prompt changes based on **input length**.  
- If text is short ‚Üí "Explain in detail."  
- If text is long ‚Üí "Summarize in 3 lines."

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Chain of Thought Prompting
- Write a prompt **utilising the concept of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting**.  
- Encourage the model to **reason step by step** before giving the final answer.  
- Example:  
  - Prompt: "Explain how to solve this physics problem step by step."  
  - The model shows reasoning first, then provides the final solution.  
- In the video, explain **what CoT prompting is** and how you have **utilised it** in your project.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Tokens and Tokenization
- **Log the number of tokens used** in the console/terminal after every AI call.  
- Helps track **how much of your quota is used** and how models process text internally.  
- Example:  
  - Input note: "Hello"  
  - Tokens used: Prompt = 47, Response = 102, Total = 149  
- In the video, explain **what tokens are** and how **tokenization works**.  



---
## üìù Conclusion

This project is not about building a big app.  
It is just to **learn the 7 basic AI concepts** step by step:  
- how prompting works,  
- how examples guide the model  

By checking each branch, you can **see the difference directly**.  
It‚Äôs a clean, simple way to understand how to work with Gemini API for real projects later.
